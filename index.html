          <p>Users can load their animation with a .txt file 
            (<a href="https://github.com/mchall92/Easy-Animator/blob/main/resources/README-v3.md">instructions</a>) 
            or start with an empty canvas. This player supports five basic 
            functions: play, pause, stop, loop/unloop and mute/unmute 
            background music while they are also allowed to change the 
            speed of the animation. Users can edit the animation by 
            clicking on the “settings” button. To enhance user friendliness 
            and accessibility, we added two extra functions: current time 
            and object IDs (by checking the "Show Object ID" box) so that 
            users know which object they are editing. Outputting the 
            animation as .txt and .svg files is also supported.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>This application generally follows the Model-View-Controller 
              design. There are <b><i>two</i></b> software design strategies we have 
              adopted in our application: </p>
            <p><b>Adapter design pattern:</b></p>
            <p> 
              We separate the interface of our model into two, one that 
              only provides getter methods while the other one extends 
              all methods. With this design, our view has a direct 
              reference to model which is limited to getter methods 
              without mediating through controller.</p>
              <p>
                <b>SOLID principles:</b>
              </p>
              <p><b>(a)</b> The complexity of our model is separated out 
                into smaller classes to adhere to single responsibility.</p>
              <p><b>(b)</b> We encpasulate actions in our view to callback 
                methods in an interface that controller implements so 
                that we can close for modification but open for future 
                extension. </p>
              <p><b>(c)</b> We also split up our view interface for 
                  interface segregation. This design will help 
                  hide methods that users do not need under different 
                  view mode.</p>
              <p> </p>
              
              <p>Finally, our model is done by 
                <b>pair programming</b>.</p>
